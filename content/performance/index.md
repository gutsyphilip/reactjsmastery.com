---> This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

Many React applications are slow! Others are pretty fast too. In nearly every case, those you might consider as fast could be faster. What makes the difference?

This course is designed to take you beyond simply building web applications with React. You would learn various ways to optimize your React applications for performance without compromising functionality. The methods we'd be applying will range from minor syntax changes to better development practices to architectural concerns and will be explored following a practical approach. If this doesn’t excite you, I’m not sure what will.

Course Structure
Using a simple React application which is currently un-optimized, we will go through the performance tips / concepts outlined below. We will walk through them, showing exactly how they may be applied and the benefits when used in our sample application. We would do a before and after comparison of the application to highlight the performance gains along the way.
